\begin{abstract}
The calving of giant icebergs from the Antarctic ice shelves accounts for approximately half of Antarctic ice-shelf decay. After calving, these tabular icebergs drift across large distances, altering regional ocean circulation, bottom-water formation, sea-ice production and biological primary productivity in the icebergs' vicinity.
However, despite their importance, the current generation of numerical models is unable to represent giant tabular icebergs in a physically realistic way.
In this study we develop a novel framework to model giant tabular icebergs submerged in the ocean. In this framework, tabular icebergs are constructed out of Lagrangian elements that drift in the ocean, and are held together by numerical bonds.
By breaking these bonds, a tabular iceberg can be made to split into smaller pieces, or to break away from an ice shelf.
We describe the Lagrangian tabular-iceberg model and discuss a number of the technical elements involved in its development. 
We demonstrate the capabilities of the model by modeling a tabular iceberg drifting away an idealized ice shelf.

%\subsection{Introduction}


The Antarctic ice shelves are characterized by large infrequent calving events where massive pieces of the ice shelves break off, to create giant tabular icebergs. Observational estimates suggest that over the past 30 years approximately half of Antarctic ice-shelf decay is due to iceberg calving, while the other half occurs through ice-shelf melting \citep{Depoorter2013, Rignot2013}. Iceberg sizes appear to fit a power law distribution, with the majority of icebergs being small (L$<$ 1 km), while the far less numerous giant tabular icebergs (L $>$ 5km) account for more than 90$\%$ of the icebergs mass \citep{Tournadre2016}. 

After calving, icebergs slowly drift away from their source glaciers, often becoming stuck in sea ice, or grounding along the Antarctic coast \citep{Lichey2001, Dowdeswell2007}. Giant tabular icebergs extend deep into the water column, and have the potential to disrupt ocean circulation patterns for months or even years after calving \citep{Robinson2012, Stern2015}.
The freshwater flux from iceberg melt impacts ocean hydrography around the iceberg, influencing sea-ice production and bottom-water formation \citep{Arrigo2002, Robinson2012, Nicholls2009}. The long distances traveled by giant icebergs before melting means that their meltwater impact is often felt hundreds of kilometers away from their calving origins \citep{Stern2016}. Meltwater injection (and the accompanying upwelling) from icebergs can also influence biological productivity by providing nutrients to the surface ocean or changing sea ice conditions \citep{Arrigo2002, Vernet2012, Biddle2015}. The increased productivity associated with free-floating tabular icebergs has been linked with local increases in ocean carbon uptake, potentially large enough to be a significant fraction of the Southern Ocean carbon sequestration \citep{Smith2007}.

%either increasing it by providing nutrients to the surface ocean, or decreasing by changing sea ice conditions

In recent years, there has been an increased interest in iceberg drift and decay. This surge of interest has been driven by (i) the need to understand polar freshwater cycles in order to create realistic climate forecasts and sea level projections \citep{Silva2006, Shepherd2007, Rignot2013}; and (ii) the increased use of high-latitudes iceberg-filled waters for shipping lanes and offshore hydrocarbon exploration in the Arctic \citep{Pizzolato2014, Unger2014, Henderson2016}. The increased interest in icebergs has led to the development of numerical models of iceberg drift and decay \citep{Mountain1980, Bigg1997, Gladstone2001, Kubat2005}, some of which have been included in global General Circulation Models \citep{Martin2010, Marsh2015}. These iceberg drift models treat icebergs as Lagrangian point particles, which are advected by the flow, and melt according to certain parameterizations for icebergs melt. Since icebergs are treated as point particles, iceberg drift models are mostly suitable for modeling icebergs smaller than an ocean grid cell. Consequently, these models have mostly been used to represent icebergs smaller than 3.5km on a global scale \citep{Jongma2009, Martin2010, Marsh2015}.

Point-particle iceberg drift models are less suitable for modeling larger tabular icebergs, where the size and structure of the iceberg may be an important feature in determining their drift and decay \citep{Stern2016}. They also are not suitable for studying the local effects that icebergs have on the surrounding ocean, or the small scale processes that influence iceberg melt and decay \citep{Wagner2014, Stern2015}. For this reason, tabular icebergs (L $>$ 5km) are currently not represented in the iceberg drift models used in climate models, even though observations suggest that tabular icebergs account for  the vast majority of the total Southern Hemisphere iceberg mass \citep{Tournadre2016}. 
%Similarly, operational iceberg models are often inadequate for projecting iceberg drift at fine scales \citep{Turnbull2015}.

The goal of this study is to develop a new iceberg model where tabular icebergs are explicitly resolved. In this model, icebergs are no longer treated as point particles that interact with the ocean at a single location, but rather icebergs are given structure, so that they interact with the ocean across multiple ocean grid cells and depress the ocean surface over a wide area. To do this, we create tabular icebergs out of many Lagrangian elements with finite extent which are `bonded' together by numerical bonds. The numerical bonds hold the ice elements together and allow a collection of elements to move as a unit. By manually breaking these bonds, we can simulate iceberg calving, allowing us to study the ocean response to giant iceberg detaching from an ice shelf (e.g.: Figure \ref{fig:Spread_area} and \ref{fig:SST_Collapse}) or the fracturing of a large iceberg into smaller pieces.

The discrete element model (DEM) developed in this study is referred to at the Lagrangian Tabular Iceberg Model (LTIM). 
%The LTIM model is coupled to the MOM6 numerical ocean model \citep{Hallberg2013}. 
Section 2 gives a description of many of the key aspects of the LTIM. Since this model is a new approach to modeling icebergs, we present many of the technical elements involved in constructing the model. In section 3 and 4, we demonstrate the capabilities of the model by simulating a tabular iceberg detaching from an idealized ice shelf.

%A prerequisite of a complete model of an ice shelf cavity with a calving ice shelf is an understanding of the physical processes involved in iceberg calving. The importance of this problem for projecting sea level has meant that the search for a ``calving law" has received much attention in recent years. However, even with a theory of ice shelf breaking, there are still significant technical barriers preventing us from modeling icebergs calving away from ice shelves in a dynamically consistent way. In this paper, we d


%This work bears some similarity to [Basis et al], who used a DEM model to model the generation and propagation of cracks within an ice shelf. The present study is distinct from [Basis et al] in that (i) we  focus on the ocean's response to iceberg calving and thus our DEM model is coupled to a fully dynamic ocean model, (ii) the element in our DEM model are of scale > 1 km, while those in Basis were much smaller (1 meter), since we focus on the large scale oceanography, rather than the small scale fracture mechanics. Finally, we do not model the breaking in iceberg bonds and ice dynamics. However, including bonds between ice elements in our model means that modeling ice shelf breaking is a natural extension to this work. 


%This same constraint is present in previous iceberg models, and has meant that those models have only been able to represent smaller icebergs (e.g. icebergs with area less than $3.5km^{2}$ in \citet{Gladstone2001, Martin2010}). However, as mentioned above, satellite observations of iceberg size show that more than 80(?) percent of Southern Hemispheric icebergs mass is stored in icebergs with areas greater than $3.5km^{2}$  \citep{Tournadre2016}, which motivates the including of larger icebergs in climate models. 

\section{Model description}
%, which can be used to model small icebergs, tabular icebergs, sea ice and ice shelf cavities
%In this section we describe many key elements of the LTIM.  
The LTIM is a Lagrangian particle-based model (or DEM model) in that the objects of the model are Lagrangian elements. Each element represents a mass of ice that is floating in the ocean, and has a position, velocity, mass, and a set of dimensions, which can evolve in time. The motion of each element is determined by a momentum equation which is solved in the (Lagrangian) reference frame of the element. The elements are forced by oceanic and atmospheric forces, which are provided by the user, or are determined by coupling the LTIM to an ocean/atmosphere model. The elements also interact with one another and can be bonded together to form larger structures. The angular momentum of the elements is not modeled explicitly; instead rotational motion of larger structures emerge as a consequence of bond orientation and collective motion. In different contexts, the LTIM elements can be thought to represent individual icebergs, sea ice flows, or, when the elements are bonded together, they can represent larger structures such as tabular icebergs or ice shelves.
%In this latter case, the LTIM model can be categorized as a discrete element model (DEM). 
% in the sense that large structures are constructed from smaller independent Lagrangian elements. 

The LTIM model is developed on the code base of an existing iceberg drift model \citep{Martin2010, Stern2016}. When run with the correct set of runtime flags, the model runs as a traditional iceberg drift model.
%
%In this section, we discuss the equations of motion governing the element movement and the thermodynamic equations governing the decay of the elements. The also discuss the interactive forces

\subsection{Equations of motion}
The elements drift in the ocean, forced by atmosphere, ocean and sea-ice drag forces, as well as the Coriolis force and a force due to the sea surface slope.  When these ice elements move alone (without interactions with other elements), they can be thought of as representing individual (or clusters of) small icebergs, and follow the same equations described in the iceberg drift model of \citet{Martin2010} (based on the equations outlined in \citet{Bigg1997} and \citet{Gladstone2001}).

In addition to the environmental forces, the elements in the LTIM model experience interactive forces due to the presence of other elements. Two types of interactive forces are included between elements. The first force is a repulsive force which is applied to elements to prevent them from moving too close to one another. This repulsive force prevents icebergs from piling up on top of one another. The second interactive force is a force due to numerical `bonds', and is only applied if two elements are labelled as `bonded'. When two elements are bonded, each element feels an attractive force that prevents the elements from moving too far apart from one another. The interactive forces between two bonded elements are defined such that in the absence of other forces the elements come to rest adjacent to one another, with no overlap of the iceberg areas.

The momentum equation for each element is given by 
\begin{equation}
\label{Iceberg_mom_eq}
M \frac{D \vec{u}}{Dt}=\vec{F}_{A} + \vec{F}_{W}+ \vec{F}_{R}+\vec{F}_{C} +\vec{F}_{SS}+\vec{F}_{SI}+\vec{F}_{IA} ,
\end{equation}
where $\frac{D}{Dt}$ is the total (Lagrangian) derivative, $M$ is the mass of the element, $\vec{u}$ is the velocity of the element, and the terms on the right hand side give the forces on the element due to air drag $(\vec{F}_{A})$, water drag $(\vec{F}_{W})$, sea ice drag $(\vec{F}_{SI})$, Coriolis force $(\vec{F}_{C})$, wave radiation force $(\vec{F}_{R})$, sea surface slope $(\vec{F}_{SS})$, and interactions with other elements ($\vec{F}_{IA}$). The environmental forces are the same as those presented in \citet{Martin2010}, and are provided for completeness in Appendix A.  The details of the interactive forces are provided in below. 


\subsection{Interactive Forces}
The interactive force on an element is calculated by adding together the interactions with all other elements, such that the interactive force on element $i$, $(\vec{F}_{IA})_{i}$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
\label{F_interaction_i}
(\vec{F}_{IA})_{i}= \Sigma_{j \neq i} (\vec{F}_{IA})_{ij},
\end{equation}
where $(\vec{F}_{IA})_{ij}$ is the force on element $i$ by element $j$. Both bonded and repulsive interactions are modeled using elastic stresses with frictional damping. The elastic component of the force is a function of the distance between the two elements, while the  frictional damping force depends on the relative velocity of the two elements.

To describe the forces between two elements, we begin by introducing some notation.  Let $\vec{x_{i}}$, $\vec{x_{j}}$ be the positions of elements i and j. The distance between elements i and j is
\begin{equation}
\label{distance}
d_{ij}= | \vec{x_{i}} - \vec{x_{j}}|.
\end{equation}
When calculating the interactive forces between elements, the elements are assumed to be circular. We define the interaction diameter of an element by 
\begin{equation}
\label{Diameter}
D_{i}=2 \sqrt{\frac{A_{i}}{\pi}},
\end{equation}
where $A_{i}$ is the planar surface area of element i. Using this, we define the critical interactive length scale, 
\begin{equation}
L_{ij}=\frac{D_{i} + D_{j}}{2},
\label{eq:Interaction_crit}
\end{equation}
which governs interactions between elements i and j. 
Repulsive forces are only applied when $d_{i,j} \textless L_{i,j}$, while for $d_{i,j} \textgreater L_{i,j}$ attractive bonded forces are applied when a bond exists between element i and j.  Bond and repulsive forces are designed such that in the absence of other forces, bonded particles will settle in an equilibrium position where elements are separated by the critical interaction length scale $L_{i,j}$.
% (see schematic in Figure \ref{fig:Interactive_forces}).

To aid in notation, we define a bond matrix $B_{ij}$ such that $B_{ij}=1$ if elements i and j are bonded together and  $B_{ij}=0$ otherwise. Using this notation, the interactive force $(\vec{F}_{IA})_{ij}$ on an element i by an element j is given by
\begin{equation}
\label{F_interactione}
(\vec{F}_{IA})_{ij}= \left\{%
  \begin{array}{ll}
   (\vec{F}_{e})_{ij} + (\vec{F}_{d})_{ij}
    & \mbox{if $d_{ij} \leq L_{ij} $ }\\
 %     & \mbox{if $|x_{i} -x_{j}| \leq \frac{1}{2}(D_{i}+D_{j}) $ }\\
    (\vec{F}_{e})_{ij} + (\vec{F}_{d})_{ij}
 %     & \mbox{if $|x_{i} -x_{j}| > \frac{1}{2}(D_{i}+D_{j}) \textrm{ and } B_{ij}=1 $ }\\
       & \mbox{if $d_{ij} >  L_{ij}  \textrm{ and } B_{ij}=1 $ }\\
      0
 %     & \mbox{if $|x_{i} -x_{j}| > \frac{1}{2}(D_{i}+D_{j}) \textrm{ and } B_{ij}=0 $ }.\\
      & \mbox{if $d_{ij} > L_{ij} \textrm{ and } B_{ij}=0 $ }.\\
  \end{array}
\right.
\end{equation}
$(\vec{F_{e}})_{ij}$ and $(\vec{F_{d}})_{ij}$ are the elastic and frictional damping components of the interactive force between elements i and j.
The elastic force $(\vec{F_{e}})_{ij}$ between elements is given by
\begin{equation}
\label{F_elastic}
(\vec{F_{e}})_{ij}= -\kappa_{e}  \bigg( d_{i,j}-L_{i,j} \bigg) T_{i,j} \vec{r}_{ij},
\end{equation}
where $\vec{r}_{ij}= \frac{(\vec{x_{i}} -\vec{x_{j}})}{|\vec{x_{i}} -\vec{x_{j}}|}$ is the directional unit vector between the position of element i and j, $\kappa_{e}$ is the spring constant, and $T_{i,j}$ is the minimum of the thickness of elements i, j. The interactive forces obey Newton's 3rd Law (i.e.: $(\vec{F}_{IA})_{ij}=-(\vec{F}_{IA})_{ji}$).
%This is in contrast to some other DEM models in the literature (e.g. \citet{Li2014}). 
The minimum thickness, $T_{i,j}$, is preferred to the average thickness, since this means that for two bonded elements a fixed distance apart, the acceleration due to elastic forces is bounded, even when the thickness of one of the elements approaches zero. 
%
%Since ice elements are able to melt entirely, the repulsive forces between elements need to be carefully defined so that they are stable even for very small elements with mass approaching zero. We define the elastic repulsive force $(F_{r})_{ij}$ between elements i and j as
%\begin{equation}
%\label{F_elastic}
%(F_{r})_{ij}= -\kappa_{r} A_{o}(i,j) T_{i,j}\vec{r},
%\end{equation}
%where $A_{o}(i,j)$ is the overlap area of the two circles centered at $\vec{x_{i}}$ and $\vec{x_{j}}$, with diameter $D_{i}$ and $D_{j}$ (see Figure \ref{fig:Interactive_forces}), respectively, and $\kappa_{r}$ is the repulsive spring constant. We choose $(F_{r})_{ij}$ to be proportional to the overlap area between the interactive circles surrounding each element so that the acceleration due to this repulsive force is bounded, even as the element mass approaches zero.   This consideration is not needed for the bonded force, since element bonds will be broken when elements are smaller than a threshold size. 
%[Should we use a bonded force given by  $(F_{b})_{ij}= -\kappa_{b}  \bigg( d_{i,j}-L_{i,j}) \bigg)^{2} T_{i,j} \vec{r}$ rather? Come back to this.]

The frictional damping force has components that damp both the relative radial velocity and relative transverse velocities of the two elements. If $\vec{r}_{ij}^{\perp}$ is the direction vector perpendicular to $\vec{r}_{ij}$, and $P_{\vec{r}_{ij}}$ and $P_{\vec{r}_{ij}^{\perp}}$ are the projection matrices that project onto $\vec{r}_{ij}$ and $\vec{r}_{ij}^{\perp}$ respectively, then the frictional damping force is given by
\begin{equation}
\label{F_damping} 
%(F_{d})_{ij}=   -C_{r}|(u_{i} -u_{j}) \cdot \vec{r}   | \vec{r}  - C_{t}|(u_{i} -u_{j})\cdot  \vec{r}^{\perp} | \vec{r}^{\perp})
(\vec{F_{d}})_{ij}=   \Bigg (-c_{r} P_{\vec{r}_{ij}}  - c_{t} P_{\vec{r}_{ij}^{\perp}} \Bigg ) \cdot (\vec{u_{i}} -\vec{u_{j}} ) 
\end{equation}
Here $c_{r}$ and $c_{t}$ are the radial and transverse drag coefficients. For the simulation below, we set $c_{r}=2\sqrt{\kappa_{e} }$ and  $c_{t}=\frac{1}{4}c_{r}$ so that the radial elastic force is critically damped, and the transverse damping is sub critical. The damping forces are implemented using an implicit time stepping scheme, to avoid stability issues for very small elements (details found in Appendix B). 

The effectiveness of the repulsive forces can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:Regular_Uncoupled_sim}, which shows an uncoupled (ice only) simulation where ice elements drift westward into a bay, and eventually come to rest with minimal overlap between elements. The effectiveness of the numerical bonds is demonstrated in Figure \ref{fig:Uncoupled_sim}, where tabular icebergs (constructed from many ice elements bonded together) and individual icebergs (unbonded elements) drift together towards a convex coast line. When the tabular icebergs arrive at the coast, they bump into the coastline and begin to rotate, influencing the paths of the other icebergs. In this example we see that modeling large structures using small elements bonded together, allows us to achieve large-scale structure and rotational motion, without having to include an equation for the angular momentum of the elements (as discussed in \citet{Jakobsen2001}). Animations of these uncoupled simulations can be found in the supplementary materials.

\subsection{Initializing element geometry and packing}
For purposes of packing, we assume that elements have surface areas which are shaped as equally-sized regular hexagons (note that the elements are assumed to be circular for proposes of interactions, but are assumed to be hexagonal for packing purposes). When packing these elements together, the hexagonal elements are initially arranged in a staggered lattice, with each element bonded to the adjacent elements (see Figure  \ref{fig:Hex_intersections}a). In this arrangement, each element (away from the edges) is bonded to six other elements. The bonds between elements form a pattern of equilateral triangles, which give the larger structure rigidity. The circular shape of elements (used for interactions) is inscribed within the hexagonal shape used for packing (Figure  \ref{fig:Hex_intersections}a). The centers of adjacent elements are initially separated by a distance $d_{i,j}=L_{i,j}=2A_{p}$, where $A_{p}$ is the length the apothems of the hexagons.

Some experiments were also performed using rectangular elements, arranged in a regular (non-staggered) lattice. In this case, each element forms four bonds with adjacent elements. However, the resultant structures were found to be much less rigid and tended to collapse when sufficient forces was applied. For this reason, hexagonal elements are used here.

\subsection{Ocean-ice and ice-ocean coupling}
The LTIM model is coupled to the ocean model via a two-way synchronous coupling, meaning that ocean model fields are passed to the LTIM model and the LTIM model fields are passed back to the ocean model at every time step. Passing fields between the two models involves interpolating fields between the Eulerian grid of the ocean model and aggregating the `Lagrangian grid' of the LTIM model (i.e.: onto the ice elements). 

The coupling from the ocean model to the LTIM model is straight forward: at every time step, the ocean mixed layer temperature, salinity, velocity and sea-ice concentration are passed from the ocean model to the LTIM model, to be used in the momentum and thermodynamic equations of the ice elements. 
Since tabular icebergs are explicitly resolved in the ocean, it is sufficient for each element to interact with ocean mixed layer only (i.e.: there is no need to manually embed icebergs into the ocean by integrating ocean fields over the icebergs' thickness, as suggested in \citet{Merino2016}).
Within the LTIM model, the ocean model fields are interpolated onto the Lagrangian grid using a bilinear interpolation scheme. The LTIM model is not sensitive to the chosen interpolation scheme. 

%More care needs to be taken when passing fields back from the LTIM model to the ocean model. 
The coupling from the LTIM to ocean model is more complex.
The LTIM model influences the ocean by: (i) applying a pressure to the ocean surface, (ii) imposing heat, salinity and mass fluxes on the ocean, associated with ice melting, and (iii) affecting the upper ocean by applying a no-slip boundary condition and frictional velocity beneath the ice. Fields from the LTIM model are aggregated from the Lagrangian grid to the Eulerian ocean grid before they are passed to the ocean model. Since LTIM applies large pressures to the ocean surface, the ocean model is sensitive to the interpolation scheme used to map the LTIM fields to the ocean grid. Sudden jumps to the ocean surface pressure can trigger tsunamis within the ocean model, making the ocean model unrealistic.

The aggregation of the LTIM fields onto the ocean grid is done in a way that is consistent with the shape of the elements in the LTIM model (see Section 2.3). Fields are `spread' to the ocean model grid by exactly calculating what fraction of an element's surface area lies in a particular grid box, and dividing the field in proportion to this fraction.
%While the position of a particular element might be inside one ocean grid cell, the implied shape of the element will often intersect other ocean grid cells. 
For example, consider a hexagonal element in the LTIM model, which is positioned such that it intersects four ocean grid cells (Figure \ref{fig:Hex_intersections}b). In this situation, the mass of the element is divided between these four ocean cells in proportion to the overlap area between the hexagonal element and the grid cell (this fraction is shown by the colors in \ref{fig:Hex_intersections}b). An advantage of this approach is that there are no jumps in pressure as an element moves from one grid cell to another. 

The numerical calculation of the intersection between hexagons and the ocean grid is simplified by dividing the hexagon into 6 equilateral triangles. This method allows for the intersection to be found even when the hexagon is not aligned with the grid. %The LTIM model can be run using hexagonal or rectangular elements. 

The field-spreading scheme is coded with the restriction that an element's area can only intersect a maximum of four ocean grid cells at a time. A consequence of this is that this sets a limit on the maximum size of elements that can be represented using this model, i.e.: the longest horizontal dimension of an ice element must be smaller than the ocean grid spacing. Larger ice structures are constructed by bonding together smaller elements. 

\subsection{Thermodynamics}
The ice elements decay according to a number of melt parameterizations.  As the ice elements melt, their mass decreases, and the appropriate salt, mass and heat fluxes are passed to the ocean. In this section we described the melt parametrization for bonded, unbonded and partially bonded elements.

As mentioned above, ice elements which do not interact with other elements are modeled identically to the point particle icebergs described in \citet{Martin2010}. These elements melt according to three semi-empirical parametrization for melt commonly used in previous iceberg studies \citep{Gladstone2001,Martin2010}.  Three types of iceberg melting are used: basal melt, $M_{b}$, melt due to wave erosion, $M_{e}$ and melt due to buoyant convection, $M_{v}$. $M_{e}$ and $M_{v}$ are applied to the sides of the ice element, while $M_{b}$ is applied at the ice element base. The details of $M_{b}$. $M_{v}$ and $M_{e}$ are given in Appendix A.

When multiple elements are bonded together to form larger structures, it is no longer appropriate to use the parameterizations for melt developed for individual point-particle icebergs. An element which is completely surrounded by other elements, is meant to represent a piece of ice in the middle of a large structure, and hence will not experience a melt at its sides due to wave erosion or buoyant convection. Also, the iceberg basal melt rate, $M_{b}$ described above is based on boundary layer theory of flow past a finite plate, and is only appropriate for basal surfaces where the distance from the leading edge is sufficiently small \citep{Eckert1950, Weeks1973}. For an element in the interior of large structures, the distance from the edge of the structure is large, and so using $M_{b}$ for the basal melt is not appropriate. Instead, the basal melt, $M_{s}$ is determined using the three equation model for basal melt, which is a typical melting parametrization beneath used beneath ice shelves \citep{Holland1999}.% (see Appendix A). 

When using both individual elements and bonded elements in the same simulation, we determine which melt rate parameterizations to use based on the amount of bonds that each element has. An element which is in the center of a large structure will form the maximum number of bonds, while unbonded elements form zero bonds. If maximum number of bonds that an element can form (given the shape of the element) is $N_{max}$, and the number bonds that an element has is $N_{b}$, then the side melt and bottom melt for that element are given by
\begin{equation}
M_{side}=\frac{(N_{max}-N_{b})}{N_{max}}  (M_{v} +M_{e})
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
M_{bottom}=\frac{(N_{max}-N_{b})}{N_{max}}M_{b} +\frac{N_{b}}{N_{max}}M_{s}
\end{equation}
respectively.  In this way, elements with no bonds, melt like point-particle icebergs, elements at the center of large structures melt like ice shelves, and elements at the sides of large structures have a combination of iceberg side and basal melt, and ice-shelf melt. 





\subsection{Algorithms and computational efficiency}
Including interactions between elements leads to an increase in the computational complexity of the model. In this subsection we comment on some of the algorithmic procedures that have been used to increase the computational efficiency.

\subsubsection{Interactions and Bonds}
At every time step, we calculate the force on each element due to interactions with every other element. In principle, this involves order $N^{2}$ operations (for N elements). However, since each element only has repulsive interactions with elements that are less than one ocean grid cell away, and each element only has bonded interactions with a small number of other elements, we are able to reduce the complexity of the system. 

The complexity reduction is achieved by storing the element data in an efficient way that prevents having to search through all element pairs to check if they are close to one another or are bonded with one another. The data storage system works as follows: pointers to the memory structures containing each element are stored in linked list data structures, which allow elements to be added and removed from the lists easily without restructuring the entire list. Instead of using one list for all the elements on a processor (as was done in the original code \citep{Martin2010}), we use a separate linked list for each ocean grid cell. When an element moves between ocean grid cells, it is removed from its original list and added to the list corresponding to its new ocean grid cell. Since the area of elements has to be smaller than the area of an ocean grid cell, the critical interaction length scale (equation \ref{eq:Interaction_crit}) is less than the length of a grid cell. This means that elements only experience repulsive forces with elements in the same ocean grid cell, or in one of the 8 adjacent cells. Limiting the possible repulsive interactions to elements in these 9 linked lists substantially reduces the computational time needed to calculate the total interactive force. 

Bonded interactions are handled differently. Each bond is assigned a piece of memory. Each ice element contains a linked list of each of its bonds (typically up to six bonds per element). At each time step, the code traverses the lists of bonded elements, and adds a bonded force corresponding to these bond. The bonded force is only applied if $d_{i,j} > L_{ij}$, to avoid double counting an interaction. Having a list of bonds stored with each element reduces the computational complexity of bonded interactions from order $N^{2}$ to order N. Handling bonded attractive forces separately to the repulsive and non-bonded forces means that we do not need to check whether two elements are bonded, which further increases the computational efficiency. 

\subsubsection{Parallelization and halos}
The LTIM model runs on multiple processors in parallel (and the same grid as the ocean decomposition). When elements move from an ocean cell on one processor to an ocean cell on a second processor, the memory has to be passed from one processor the next, added and removed to the appropriate lists and the memory has to be allocated and deallocated correctly. Element interactions across the edge of processors are handled using computational halos. A computational halo is a copy of the edge of a one processor which is appended to the edge of a second processor, so that the first processor can `see' the second processor during a time step. Before each time step, elements at the edges of each processor are copied onto the halos of adjacent processors so that they can be used in calculating the interactive forces. After each time step, these halos and removed, and the process is repeated. These halo updates are one of the most computationally expensive parts of the LTIM model.

Keeping track of pairs of bonded elements that move across a processor edge requires a lot of book keeping since bonds have to be severed and reconnected. Details of how the bonds are broken and reconnected across processor boundaries are provided in Appendix~C.

\subsubsection{Time stepping}
The ice elements in the LTIM model are advected using a semi-implicit velocity Verlet time-stepping scheme. The velocity Verlet time stepping scheme is commonly used in DEM models in video games because it is computational efficient and has desirable stability properties \citep{Jakobsen2001}. This time stepping scheme was preferred to the Runge-Kutta  4, which was used in the iceberg model of \citet{Martin2010} since the Verlet time stepping only requires a calculation of the interactive forces once per time step (while the Runge-Kutta scheme requires the interactive forces to be calculated four times). Since the calculation of the interactive forces is one of the most computationally expensive part of the algorithm, the Verlet scheme leads to a significant increase in the speed of the model. We note that the Verlet scheme used in the LTIM contains a modification of the original (fully explicit) velocity Verlet time stepping scheme in that damping terms are treated implicitly (which increases the numerical stability). The details of this time stepping schemed are outline in Appendix B.

% \section{Experiment Setup}
%The introduction of Lagrangian elements, numerical bond and appropriate interpolation schemes between the Eularian and Lagrangian grids (discussed in Section 2) means that we are now able to model ice shelf cavities which undergo large calving events, and create giant tabular icebergs.

%We demonstrate this capability in an experimental setup using an idealized ice shelf. For these experiments the LTIM model is coupled to the MOM6 ocean model.
% This section contains a description of the experimental setup and numerical experiments performed. The results of these simulations are presented in Section 4. 
 
 %In the examples below, the LTIM model is firstly used in uncoupled mode to model the movement of freely drifting icebergs. Secondly, the coupled LTIM with static ice elements is used to model an idealized ice shelf cavity. Finally, the fully-coupled LTIM is used to model a tabular iceberg which calves off of this ice shelf.
 
%\subsection{Uncoupled simulation}
%We begin by demonstrating the LTIM model uncoupled to the ocean. For this experiment, we use a rectangular domain, $L_{x}=1000$ km long and $L_{y}=500$ km wide. Land points are arranged in a semi-circle, in the west of the domain, as shown by the black dots in Figure \ref{fig:Uncoupled_sim}.  Three hundred ice elements are initialized with diameters uniformly sampled from the interval [0 40km], and positioned randomly at positions with $x \leq 300$km. These ice elements can be thought to represent interacting sea ice flows or icebergs. Three `tabular icebergs' are initialized by arranging ice elements in a staggered lattices with adjacent elements bonded together, as described in Section 2.4. The three tabular icebergs contain 25, 16 and 4 elements, respectively. Each of the elements that make up the tabular icebergs has a diameter of 40km. All elements have an initial thickness of 10m.
%
%The simulation is forced by an imposed westward ocean current of u=0.1m/s. Forces due to sea surface slope, atmospheric drag, Coriolis and sea ice drag are set to zero. The initial setup is shown in Figure \ref{fig:Uncoupled_sim}a.

 \section{Experiment Setup}
The introduction of Lagrangian elements, numerical bonds and interpolation schemes between the Eularian and Lagrangian grids (discussed in Section 2) means that we now have the tools to model giant tabular icebergs submerged in the ocean. We demonstrate this capability by simulating a tabular iceberg drifting away from an idealized ice shelf. 
%This simulation is performed using the LTIM model coupled to the MOM6 ocean model \citep{Hallberg2013}. 
%This section describes the experimental setup of these numerical experiments. The results are shown in Section 4.
 
 \subsection{Model configuration}
We initialized our simulation using the experimental setup created for the Marine Ice Ocean Modeling Inter-comparion Project (MISOMIP) \citep{Asay-Davis2016}.
The configuration consists of an idealized ice shelf in a rectangular domain. The domain is $L_{x}=80$km wide and $L_{y}=480$km long, and contains an ice shelf which is grounded on the south side of the domain and has an ice front at y=650 km. The ice thickness and bottom topography of this setup are shown in Figure \ref{fig:ISOMIP_mass_and_topog}a and \ref{fig:ISOMIP_mass_and_topog}b respectively, with the grounding line position drawn in for reference. The configuration is the same as that of the Ocean0 setup in the MISOMIP, with a few minor changes to the ice-shelf geometry (see Appendix D for details).
% (see supplementary materials for details).
%
%with three changes made:
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item The `calving criteria' used in the MISOMIP study (which states that all points in the ice shelf with thickness less than 100m are set to zero thickness) has not been used.
%\item The ice shelf has been thickened on the flanks of the domain, so that the latitude of the grounding line increases away from the center of the ice shelf.
%\item The ice shelf is configured to be symmetric about its meridional center line ($x=\frac{L_{x}}{2}$). This was achieved by using the average of the left and right flanks of the ice-shelf thickness. 
%\end{enumerate}
%These three changes were made in order to make the circulation beneath the ice shelf easier to interpret. 

%\textbf{Initializing Lagrangian elements:}\\
\subsection{Initializing Lagrangian elements:}
The idealized ice shelf is constructed out of Lagrangian ice elements.
Ice elements are hexagonal and are arranged in a regular staggered lattice (as discussed in Section 2.3). The sides of the gridded hexagons are initialized with length $S=0.98$ km. %Recall that the element size must be smaller than the ocean grid spacing (i.e.: $2S<\Delta x$ = 2 km). 
Gaps along the boundaries are filled in using smaller elements so that the total ice-shelf area is preserved. The initial mass of the ice elements is determined by a preprocessing inversion step, which is the inverse of the `mass-spreading' interpolation procedure discussed in Section 2.3. 
The pre-interpolation ice draft (treating elements as point masses) contains large grid artifacts (Figures \ref{fig:ISOMIP_mass_and_topog}c). These grid artifacts are much reduced after the mass-spreading interpolation is applied (Figure \ref{fig:ISOMIP_mass_and_topog}b).

%Figure \ref{fig:ISOMIP_mass_and_topog}c shows what the ice-shelf draft would be if the draft were calculated from the mass of elements in each ocean grid cell without spreading an element's mass across neighboring cells (i.e.: treating elements as point masses). Figure \ref{fig:ISOMIP_mass_and_topog}b shows the draft after spreading the mass across grid cells. When the mass spreading interpolation scheme is not used, grid artifacts seen in the ice-shelf draft (Figure \ref{fig:ISOMIP_mass_and_topog}c). These grid artifacts are much reduced when the mass spreading interpolation is used (Figure \ref{fig:ISOMIP_mass_and_topog}b). 

\subsection{Ocean model setup}
The LTIM model is coupled to the MOM6 ocean model \citep{Hallberg2013}. The ocean model is run using a vertical coordinate system which is a hybrid between a sigma-level and a z-level coordinate. In particular, model layers bend underneath the ice shelf as they would in a sigma-coordinate model, but collapse to zero thickness when they intersect with bottom topography, as they would in a z-level model. The coordinate system was achieved using ALE regridding-remapping scheme \citep{White2009}. The model uses a horizontal resolution of 2km, and 72 vertical layers.
All simulations were repeated using the ocean model configured in isopycnal mode (results were similar and are not presented here).
%(select results are shown in the supplementary material). 

Ocean parameters are as specified in the MISOMIP configuration \citep{Asay-Davis2016}, and are shown in Table 1. The simulation is initially at rest, with horizontally uniform initial ocean temperature and salinity profiles which vary linearly between specified surface and bottom values: $T_{top}=-1.9^{\circ}$C, $T_{bottom}=1.0^{\circ}$C, $S_{top}=33.8$ psu, $S_{bottom}=34.7$. The maximum ocean depth is $H_{ocean}=720$ m.  A sponge layer is used on the northern boundary, which relaxes back to the initial temperature and salinity with a relaxation time scale of $T_{sponge}=0.1$ days. Melting is set to zero for ocean cells where the ocean column thickness is less than 10m to avoid using more energy to melt ice than is present in the water column.


\subsection{Spinup and iceberg calving:}
% \subsection{Tabular iceberg calving}
The model is spun up for 5 years with all ice elements being held stationary. After spinup, a giant tabular iceberg is `broken off' from the ice shelf, and allowed to drift into the open ocean. This is achieved by allowing all ice elements initially within a 14.4 km radius of the center of the ice front to move freely while the other ice elements continue to be held stationary. Ice elements less than 12 km from the center of the ice front, are bonded together to form a semi-circular tabular iceberg. A ring of elements whose distance, $d$, from the ice front center obeys $12 \textrm{ km} \leq   d \leq14.4 \textrm{ km}$, are allowed to move freely, but have all their bonds removed. Elements in this half annulus represent fragments of the ice shelf which calve into small pieces during a large calving event. Breaking the bonds of these surrounding elements allows the tabular iceberg to move away from the ice-shelf cavity more easily.

After the spinup period, a wind stress $\vec{\tau} = <\tau_{x},\tau_{y}> = < 0.05, 0.05 >$  $\frac{N}{m^{2}}$ is applied to drive the tabular iceberg away from the ice-shelf cavity. Perturbation experiments were performed using other wind stress values. 

%\begin{enumerate}
%\item
%\textbf{Tabular iceberg with fixed velocity}:\\
%In this simulation, the velocity of the non-stationary elements is fixed to u=0m/s, v=0.01m/s. This simulation allows us to study the response of the ocean to disturbance caused by a tabular iceberg moving through the water (with an fixed velocity). This simulation is not fully coupled since the velocity of the elements is prescribed.
%\item
%\textbf{Tabular iceberg with bonded elements}:\\
 %All non-stationary ice elements are bonded together by the numerical bonds. This experiments is fully-coupled in that the ice elements are driven the ocean, and the pressure exerted by the ice elements drives ocean flow. In order to make the iceberg drift away from the ice shelf, we imposed a zonal wind stress of $\tau_{x}$ = 0.1 $\frac{N}{m^{2}}$. .
%\item
%\textbf{Tabular iceberg with unbonded elements}:\\
%This simulation is identical to the bonded elements simulation, except that all the numerical bonds are broken, so that the elements are free to move away from one another.
%\end{enumerate}



%\section{Results}
%\subsection{Uncoupled simulation}
%Figure \ref{fig:Uncoupled_sim} shows the results of the uncoupled simulation described in subsection 3.1. The figure shows snapshots of the positions of ice elements at after t=0, 300, 600 and 900 days.  During the simulation, the ice elements drift westward with the prescribed ocean current until the reach the land boundary on the western side of the domain.  Once the elements reach the western coastline, the elements become trapped against the coast and can not move further. When new elements approach the elements at the coast, they interact with the elements already at the coast, and are repulsed. The elements eventually settle in an equilibrium position where there is minimal overlap between elements.
%
%The tabular icebergs also drift westward towards the coast. The elements within the tabular icebergs which arrive first at the coastline  bump up against the coastline (or elements already at the coast). This interaction causes the tabular icebergs to rotate, and change directions. The tabular icebergs continue to drift and interact with other elements until they too settle into an equilibrium position and come to rest. The rotation of the tabular icebergs confirms the this solid body rotation can me modeled using elements and bonds, without having to include an equation for the angular momentum of the elements (as discussed in \citet{Jakobsen2001}).
%
%Comparing the northern and southern halves of the simulation shows how large tabular icebergs can interfere with the trajectories and movement of smaller icebergs (or sea ice flows). These types of interactions will likely play an important role in ice choked fjords [reference] and Antarctic coastal regions [reference].

\section{Model Results}

%\subsection{Mass spreading}
%When the model is run, the average ice draft in an ocean grid cell, is calculated from the total mass of ice elements in that grid cell by assuming that the ice elements are in hydrostatic balance. The total mass is found by summing up over all ice elements located in that grid cell, while allowing elements to spread their mass across neighboring grid cells (as discussed in Section 2.3). Figure \ref{fig:ISOMIP_mass_and_topog}b shows the draft of the ice shelf above the ice shelf cavity in the coupled static ice shelf simulation using this interpolation method, while Figure \ref{fig:ISOMIP_mass_and_topog}c shows the draft which is calculated without spreading an elements mass across neighboring cells (i.e.: treating elements as point masses). When the mass spreading interpolation scheme is not used, grid artifacts seen in the ice shelf draft (Figure \ref{fig:ISOMIP_mass_and_topog}c). The grid artifacts are much reduced when the mass spreading interpolation is used (Figure \ref{fig:ISOMIP_mass_and_topog}b). In simulations without mass spreading, irregularities in ice draft cause irregularities in the ocean surface pressure, which cause spurious motion in the ocean (not shown). This is much reduced or absent when mass spreading is used.

%\subsection{Coupled simulation}



%Figures \ref{fig:Melt_comparison} show the time-averaged melt rates of both the Lagrangian and Eulerian ice shelf models, averaged over the first 5 years of the simulation.   The melt rates of the Eulerian and Lagrangian models are very similar with slight difference showing up at the grounding line and ice front (Figure \ref{fig:Melt_comparison}). The slight difference at the grounding line are a result of the fact that elements in the LTIM model are smaller than a grid cell in length. This means that ice element near the grounding line may be ungrounded in the LTIM model, while the grid cell is considered grounded in the Eularian model. At the ice front, the Eularian model has a straight ice front, while the LTIM model has a staggered ice front, which is a result of the staggered hexagonal packing. 

%The small changes in melt at the grounding line and ice front drive slight changes to the circulation beneath the ice shelf, which in turn lead to small difference in the temperature and salinity profiles over time. This is seen by comparing the time-averaged ocean salinity profiles for the Lagrangian and Eularian ice shelves (Figure \ref{fig:Salt_comparison} ) and also  by comparing the the time-averaged barotropic stream function of the two simulations (see Figures \ref{fig:Bt_comparison}) and in the supplementary material).



%\subsection{Decaying ice shelf experiment}
%In the decaying ice shelf experiment, the ice shelf is allowed to decay as it melts. As the ice shelf melts, it decays and the pressure on the top layer of the ocean model decreases (Figure \ref{fig:Decaying_shelf}). The ice shelf decays most rapidly near to the grounding line. Grounding line migration due to melt does not take place since melting is set to zero where the ocean thickness is less that 10m. 

%As the ice shelf melts, there is a mass flux into the ocean. The integrated sea surface height north of the ice shelf does not change during the course of the simulation, since the extra mass flux into the ocean, is exactly offset by a decrease mass of the ice shelf, as expected.  

%\subsection{Tabular iceberg calving experiment}

During spinup, the injection of buoyant meltwater at the base of the ice shelf drives a clockwise circulation within the domain (not shown). The circulation compares well with an identical static ice-shelf experiment run using an Eularian ice shelf model \citep{Goldberg2012}  (a detailed comparison of the Lagrangian and Eularian ice shelf models is presented in a separate study, and is not shown here). 

Once spinup is complete, the elements near the ice-shelf front are allowed to move freely, and the icebergs begin to drift away from the ice shelf (see animations in the supplementary materials). The semi-circular tabular iceberg moves as a cohesive unit due to the presence of the numerical bonds, while the smaller ice fragments quickly disperse (Figure \ref{fig:Spread_area}). The tabular iceberg drifts towards the northward east, driven by the wind and steered by the Coriolis force.

A warming of the surface waters is observed around the tabular iceberg, with the largest warming occurring at the ice-shelf front and along the tabular iceberg's rounded edge (Figure \ref{fig:SST_Collapse}). This surface warming is caused by upwelling of the warmer waters from beneath the ice shelf and iceberg. As the icebergs drifts away from the ice shelf, these warmer waters remain at the surface, mapping of the wake of the iceberg  (Figure \ref{fig:SST_Collapse}). The signature of upwelling water in the wake of a drifting tabular iceberg bears some similarity to satellite observations of streaks of increased ocean color in the wake of tabular iceberg in the Southern Ocean \citep{Duprat2016}, suggesting that the increased productivity around icebergs may be driven by upwelling water delivering nutrients to the surface.

The motion of the tabular iceberg disturbs the ocean surface, which drives ocean velocities through out the water column (Figure \ref{fig:Velocity_section_Collapse}). The elevated shears around the tabular iceberg lead to increased vertical mixing in the vicinity of the iceberg, which alters the stratification of the water column (Figure \ref{fig:Temperature_section_Collapse}), heating the upper ocean. The increased ocean velocities and increased surface temperatures cause elevated melt rates at the base of the ice shelf and iceberg (Figure \ref{fig:Collapse_solo_melt}). The largest melt rates are observed at the newly calved ice-shelf front and on the rounded side of the iceberg (Figure \ref{fig:Collapse_solo_melt}a), where the iceberg calving has created steep ice cliffs. These sharp ice fronts allow for large ocean currents (Figure \ref{fig:Collapse_solo_melt}c), which drive the elevated melt rates. The elevated melt rates act to smooth out the ice front over time, making the ice cliff less steep. While this is likely a real phenomena that could be observed in nature, we should be wary of the modeled velocities at the ice cliffs, since large changes in ice thicknesses are often associated with numerical pressure gradient errors which can drive spurious motion.
 
As mentioned above, the direction (and speed) of the iceberg drift is largely determined by the wind speed and direction. Perturbation experiments using different wind stresses show that for sufficiently large winds, the tabular iceberg drifts to the north east when $\tau_{x} >0$, and to the north west when $\tau_{x} <0$ (not shown). For a purely zonal wind stress with $|\tau_{x}| \leq 0.01 \frac{\textrm{N}}{\textrm{m}^{2}}$, the iceberg does not move away from the ice shelf. 
When the wind is purely offshore ($\tau_{x} = 0.0 \frac{\textrm{N}}{\textrm{m}^{2}}$), a meridional wind stress $\tau_{y} \geq 0.05 \frac{\textrm{N}}{\textrm{m}^{2}}$ is needed to move the tabular iceberg away from the ice shelf.
While this result is partly an artifact of the artificial shape of the calving iceberg, it is also consistent with \citet{Bassis2013} who noted that calving is a two step process consisting of (i) ice-shelf breaking and (ii) iceberg detachment. The results here suggest that strong (cross-shore) winds may be required to drive large tabular icebergs away from their mother glaciers.

Finally, we note that the numerical bonds in the LTIM model are needed in order to allow the tabular iceberg to retain its shape. Comparing the iceberg calving simulation with an identical simulation where all numerical bonds have been removed, shows that in the absence of the bonds, the ice elements quickly disperse (Figure \ref{fig:Bond_vs_No_bond}). In this case, the model behavior is more similar to an ice-shelf disintegration and does not create a cohesive tabular iceberg. By breaking some (but not all) numerical bonds, we can simulate the fracturing of tabular icebergs, allowing tabular icebergs to break into smaller pieces (Figure ???). The breaking of a tabular iceberg increases decay rate of the iceberg by increasing the surface area of ice exposed to the ocean. Splitting the tabular iceberg into smaller fragments also allows the fragments of the iceberg to move more rapidly, and be more strongly influenced by the wind. 

%\subsubsection{Tabular iceberg with fixed velocity}
%\textbf{Tabular iceberg with fixed velocity}\\
%The fixed iceberg velocity calving experiment demonstrates that the model is able to simulate a tabular iceberg being calved from an ice shelf.  After the iceberg calves, it moves northwards away from the ice shelf with a prescribed velocity. After the iceberg has calved away from the ice shelf, we observed a warming of the surface waters near the near the ice front and iceberg edge. This surface warming is caused by an upwelling of the warmer waters from beneath the ice shelf and iceberg. As the icebergs drifts away from the ice front, these warmer waters remain in the wake of the iceberg (Figures \ref{fig:Calving_fixed_top}). The signature of upwelling water in the wake of a drifting tabular iceberg bears some similarity to satellite observations of streaks of increased ocean color near to tabular iceberg in the Southern Ocean [reference],  suggesting that the increased productivity around iceberg may be driven by upwelling water delivering nutrients to the surface. The motion of the iceberg also drives barotropic velocities through out the water column, which disturb the initial stratification of the water column (Figures \ref{fig:Calving_fixed_side}). 

%\subsubsection{Fully coupled tabular iceberg}
%\textbf{Fully coupled tabular iceberg}\\
%The necessity of bonds between ice elements is demonstrated by comparing two simulations where an iceberg calves, and is allowed to evolve freely with the flow. In the Bonded simulation, the elements in the calved iceberg are bonded together, while in the Unbonded simulation the all bonds between elements in the tabular iceberg are broken. 

%The motions of elements in the tabular iceberg in these two simulations are rather different. 
%In the Bonded simulation, the ice element in the tabular iceberg remain close to one another, and the tabular iceberg retains its shape (Figure \ref{fig:Bond_vs_No_bond}a,c). The elements are forced by the melt-water-driven current at the ice front, which moves towards the north-west (see Figure \ref{fig:static_solo} in the supplementary material). This current, together with the Coriolis force, cause the iceberg to rotate before moving away from the ice shelf (Figure \ref{fig:Bond_vs_No_bond}a). 

%In the Unbonded simulation, the ice elements in tabular iceberg are not constrained to move together. Instead, the elements spread out and drift towards the north-west for the same reason discussed above. Since the ice elements are not closely, packed together, they apply a smaller pressure to the ocean surface, spread over a larger area (Figure \ref{fig:Bond_vs_No_bond}c). The type of behavior could be relevant in simulating ice shelf disintegrations, rather than tabular iceberg calving. 


 \section{Summary}
In this study we present a novel framework for representing tabular icebergs in numerical ocean models. In this framework, giant tabular icebergs are constructed from collections of Lagrangian elements that are held together by numerical bonds. Constructing tabular icebergs out of many independent elements allows the icebergs to interact with the ocean across a wide area (larger than a grid cell), and behave as if they had a finite size and structure. This is in contrast to previous representations of icebergs in numerical models \citep{Jongma2009, Martin2010, Marsh2015} that represent icebergs as point particles. Explicitly resolving tabular icebergs in the ocean allows the icebergs to interact with the ocean in a more realistic way, and allows us to study the effect that tabular icebergs have on the ocean circulation. Including numerical bonds between elements allows for the possibility of breaking bonds to simulation iceberg calving and fracture. 

The capabilities of the tabular iceberg model were demonstrated by modeling a tabular iceberg drifting away from an idealized ice shelf (also constructed using Lagrangian elements). The results show that explicitly resolving the iceberg in the ocean allowed for a complex interaction between the tabular iceberg and the surrounding ocean. In our setup, the tabular iceberg is driven away from the ice shelf by ocean currents, wind stress, and the Coriolis force. As the iceberg moves through the water, it disturbs the ocean surface, driving barotropic ocean currents. The motion of the iceberg and melt beneath the iceberg drive upwelling along the sides of the iceberg, which entrains ambient water and causes a warming of the surface ocean in the wake of the iceberg. The changing ocean conditions feed back onto the iceberg, affecting its motion and melt rates. The highest melt rates are observed at edge of the iceberg which has the steepest ice cliff. These have the effect of smoothing out the ice edge over time.
Simulations without using numerical bonds showed that these bonds are essential for allowing the iceberg to move as a unit. We also demonstrate that by breaking these numerical bonds we can simulate iceberg fracture, which is important process that increases the rate of iceberg decay.

To our knowledge, the model presented in this study is the first model to explicitly resolve drifting tabular icebergs in an ocean model that can be used for climate. A natural extension of this work is to try to include tabular icebergs into a general circulation model (GCM) used for climate projections. 
However, before this can be done, there are a number of issues that need to be resolved:
firstly, the question of how and when to introduce tabular icebergs into the ocean needs to be addressed. For GCM's with active ice shelves, a calving law is needed to decide when to release the tabular iceberg into the ocean. The question of what calving law to use is a topic of ongoing research \citep{Benn2007, Alley2008, Levermann2012, Bassis2013} and is still unresolved. One potential way to temporarily bypass this problem would be to run hindcast simulations using historically observed calving events. 
A related issue is the question of how and when to break the bonds within the freely floating icebergs to simulation iceberg breakup. Without a rule for iceberg breakup, the tabular icebergs would likely drift to unrealistically low latitudes. Finally, further work is needed to understand (and model) the interactions between tabular icebergs and sea ice, and to parametrize the effects of iceberg grounding, as these interactions play a large role in dictating the trajectories of tabular icebergs. None-the-less, the technical framework described in this article is potentially a using step towards including tabular icebergs in global GCM's, and hence a step towards making more accurate projections of future sea level. 



\section{Appendix A}
\subsection{Environmental forces on ice elements}
The non-interactive forces on an ice element are as described in \citep{Martin2010}, and are repeated here for completeness. 
The forces on an element due to air (a), ocean (o) and sea ice (si) drag are given by
\begin{equation}
(\vec{F}_{a}) = \rho_{a} (0.5 c_{a,v} W F + c_{a,h} L W) | \vec{u}_{a} - \vec{u}|(\vec{u}_{a} - \vec{u}),
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
(\vec{F}_{o}) = \rho_{o} (0.5 c_{o,v} W (D-T_{si})F + c_{o,h} L W) | \vec{u}_{o} - \vec{u}|(\vec{u}_{o} - \vec{u}),
\label{eq:ocean_drag_eq}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
(\vec{F}_{si}) = \rho_{si} (0.5 c_{si,v} W T_{si}F + c_{si,h} L W) | \vec{u}_{si} - \vec{u}|(\vec{u}_{si} - \vec{u}).
\end{equation}
Here $\rho_{a}$, $\rho_{o}$, $\rho_{si}$, are the density of air, ocean and sea ice, respectively. $c_{a,v}$, $c_{o,v}$ and $c_{si,v}$ are the vertical drag coefficients with air, ocean and sea ice, while $c_{a,h}$, $c_{o,h}$ and $c_{si,h}$ are the respective horizontal drag coefficients. $\vec{u}_{a}$, $\vec{u}_{o}$, $\vec{u}_{si}$, are the velocities air, ocean and sea ice, respectively. L, W, T, F and D are the length, width, thickness, freeboard and draft of the ice element. The element thickness is related to the draft and freeboard by $T=F+D$ and $D=\frac{\rho}{\rho_{o}} T$, where $\rho$ is the ice element density. $T_{si}$ is the sea ice thickness.

The  wave radiation force $(\vec{F}_{R})$ is given by
\begin{equation}
\vec{F}_{R} = \frac{1}{2}\rho_{o} c_{r} g a \textrm{ min}(a,F)  \textrm{ } 2\frac{WL}{W+L} \frac{\vec{v}_{a}}{|\vec{v}_{a} |}
\end{equation}
where g is the acceleration due to gravity, a is the wave amplitude empirically related to the wind speed by  $a=0.010125|\vec{v}_{a} -  \vec{v}_{o}| $, and $c_{wd}$ is the wave drag coefficient defined as 
\begin{equation}
c_{wd}=0.06 \textrm{ min} \Bigg( \textrm{ max} \Bigg[0,\frac{L-L_{c}}{L_{t}-L_{c} } \Bigg]  , 1    \Bigg), 
\end{equation}
where $L_{w}=0.32|\vec{v}_{a} -  \vec{v}_{o}|^{2}$ is an empirical wave length, $L_{c}=0.125 L_{w}$ is the cutoff length, and  $L_{t}=0.25 L_{w}$ is the upper limit.

The pressure gradient force is approximated as a force due to sea surface slope and given by
\begin{equation}
\vec{F}_{SS} = -M g \vec{\nabla} \eta
   \end{equation}
where $\eta$ is the sea surface height. 

\subsection{Melt rate parametrization}
As discussed in Section 2.5, unbounded ice elements in the LTIM model decay according to parameterizations for iceberg decay typically used in iceberg drift models \citep{Martin2010}, while ice elements within larger ice structures have only a basal melt given by the three equation model \citep{Holland1999} .

For unbonded ice elements, the element thickness decays due to basal melt at a rate $M_{b}$, while the length and width of the elements decay as a result of melt due to wave erosion, $M_{e}$, and melt due to buoyant convection, $M_{v}$. Following \citet{Gladstone2001} and \citet{Martin2010}, the basal melt rate, wave erosion melt rate, and buoyant convection melt rate are parameterized by 
\begin{equation}
M_{b} = 0.58 | \vec{v} - \vec{v}_{0}|^{0.8} \frac{\tilde{T}_{0} - \tilde{T}}{L^{0.2}}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
M_{e} = \frac{1}{12} S_{s} \Bigg(  1 + \cos{[\pi A_{i}^{3}]}  \Bigg) \Bigg( \tilde{T}_{0} +2 \Bigg ),
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
M_{v} =  \Bigg(7.62 \times 10^{-3}  \Bigg )   \tilde{T}_{0} + \Bigg( 1.29 \times 10^{-3} \Bigg)\tilde{T}_{0}^{2}.
\end{equation}
$\tilde{T}$ is the effective iceberg temperature and is set to $\tilde{T}=4^{\circ}$C, $\tilde{T}_{0}$ is the temperature at the top of the ocean,  $A_{i}$ is the sea ice area fraction, and $S_{s}$ is the sea state, which is given by the Beaufort scale
\begin{equation}
S_{s} =  \frac{2}{3}  | \vec{u}_{a} - \vec{u}_{o} |^{\frac{1}{2}}  +\frac{1}{10}   | \vec{u}_{a} -\vec{u}_{o} |
\end{equation}
All three melt rates are in units of meters per day. 

For elements inside larger structures, the melt due to wave erosion  and melt due to buoyant convection are set to zero, and the basal melt, $M_{s}$ is given by the standard three equation model \citep{Holland1999}. 
%\begin{equation}
%M_{s} =\frac{ 1}{L_{ice} \rho_{ice} }    \rho_{o} c_{po}\gamma_{T}  \Bigg(  T_{o} -T_{f}(S_{o},p_{o})  \Bigg)
%\end{equation}
%where $T_{o}$, $S_{o}$, $p_{o}$ are the ocean mixed layer temperature, salinity and pressure.  $T_{f}(S_{ml}, p_{ml})$ is the salinity and pressure dependent freezing point of sea water at salinity $S_{o}$ and pressure $p_{o}$. $\gamma_{T}$ is the turbulent transfer coefficient given by
%\begin{equation}
%\gamma_{T}=\frac{1}{\Gamma_{Turb} +\Gamma^{T}_{Molec}}
%\end{equation}


\section{Appendix B}
\subsection{Modified Verlet Algorithm}
The LTIM model uses a version velocity Verlet time-stepping algorithm, which has been modified to allow part of the forcing to be calculated implicitly. The traditional velocity Verlet algorithm is commonly used in molecular dynamics, as it is simple to implement, second order accurate and computationally efficient \citep{Swope1982, Omelyan2002}.
Here we modify the traditional scheme to allow for the drag forces to be modeled implicitly, which prevents large accelerations for element's whose mass approaches zero. 
To do this, we include both an implicit and explicit acceleration, $a=a^{exp} +a^{imp}$. The explicit acceleration, $a^{exp}$ includes all forcing terms which depend only on the previous time step and the current position, while the implicit acceleration, $a^{imp}$ includes forcing terms which depend on the velocity at the current time step (in particular the drag and Coriolis forces).  

%1) $ x(t_{n+1}) = x(t_{n}) + u(t_{n}) \Delta t  + \frac{1}{2} \Delta t^{2} a(t_{n}) $.\\
%2) Calculate $a(t_{n+1})$\\
%3) $u(t_{n+1}) = u(t_{n}) + \frac{\Delta t}{2} \Bigg(a(t_{n}) + a(t_{n+1}) \Bigg)$\\
%Note that in step 2, $a(t_{n+1})$ is an explicit function of  $x(t_{n+1})$ and other quantites evaluated at time $t_{n}$.

Using a time step of $\Delta t$, and subscripts to denote the time step (so that $t_{n+1}= t_{n} + \Delta t$), the modified velocity Verlet scheme can be written as:\\
1) $ x_{n+1} = x_{n} + u_{n} \Delta t  + \frac{1}{2} \Delta t^{2} \Bigg(a^{exp}_{n} + a^{imp}_{n} \Bigg) $.\\
2) Calculate $a^{exp}_{n+1}$\\
% (which is a function of $x_{n+1}$, and other quantities measured at time $t_{n}$). \\
3) Calculate $a^{imp}_{n+1}$ and $u_{n+1} = u_{n} + \frac{\Delta t}{2} \Bigg(a^{exp}_{n} + a^{exp}_{n+1} \Bigg) +  (\Delta t) a^{imp}_{n+1}$\\
%  (which is a function of $u_{n+1}$, $x_{n+1}$, and other quantities measured at time $t_{n}$)
This scheme reduces to the traditional velocity Verlet when $a^{imp}$ is set to zero. Note that $a^{exp}_{n+1} = a^{exp}_{n+1}(x_{n+1}, t_{n})$ is an explicit function of  $x_{n+1}$ and other quantities evaluated at time $t_{n}$, while $a^{imp}_{n+1}=a^{imp}_{n+1}(u_{n+1}, x_{n+1}, t_{n})$ additionally depends on $u_{n+1}$, and needs to be solved implicitly. For this reason in step three, $a^{imp}_{n+1}$ and $u_{n+1}$ need to be solved simultaneously, as described in the next subsection.

In equation (1), the forces due to ocean drag, atmospheric drag and sea ice drag are treated implicitly. The force due to sea surface slope and wave radiation are treated explicitly. The Coriolis term is handled using Crank-Nicolson scheme so that half of the effect is implicit and half is explicit. The elastic part of the interactive forces is treated explicitly, while the interactive damping is handled semi-implicitly in that the drag force on element A by element B depends on the velocities of elements A and B evaluated at time $t_{n+1}$ and $t_{n}$, respectively. 
 
 %A full description of how the scheme is implemented is provided below.
 
 \subsection{Solving for the velocity implicitly}
Since this modified scheme contains some forcing terms which are handled implicitly, $a^{imp}_{n+1}$ and $u_{n+1}$ need to be calculated simultaniously.  We demonstrate how this is done, using a simplified one-dimensional version of equation (1), neglecting the atmospheric drag, sea ice drag and Coriolis force, so that the only implicitly treated term is the ocean drag. In this demonstration, we use a superscript to denote the ocean drag force, $F^{o}$, and ocean velocity, $u^{o}$, to avoid confusion with the subscripts indicating time step. We also define an explicit force, $F^{exp}$, which accounts for all forces not proportional the element velocity. With these simplifications, the implicit and explicit accelerations are
 \begin{equation}
a^{exp} =\frac{1}{M} ( \vec{F}^{exp} )
\end{equation}
 \begin{equation}
a^{imp} =\frac{1}{M} (F^{o})
\end{equation}
The ocean drag force at time $t_{n+1}$ is modeled (mostly) implicitly as 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Drag}
F^{o}_{n+1} = \tilde{c}^{o} |u^{o}_{n} -u_{n} | (u^{o}_{n} -u_{n+1} ),
\end{equation}
where $\tilde{c}^{o}$ is the effective drag coefficient, accounting for the dimensions of the ice element (see equation \ref{eq:ocean_drag_eq}).  
 
%The consequences of the drag not being fully implicit are discussed below. 
Step 3 of the modified velocity Verlet scheme can be rewritten by introducing an intermediate velocity $u^{*}$, which only depends on the velocity and acceleration at time $t_{n}$,
 \begin{equation}
 u^{*}_{n} =  u_{n}  + \frac{1}{2} (\Delta t) a^{exp}_{n}. 
 \end{equation}
Using this, the updated velocity (Step 3) can be written 
 %\begin{equation}
 %x(t_{n+1}) = x(t_{n}) + v^{*}(t_{n}) \Delta t 
 % \end{equation}
 \begin{equation}
u_{n+1} = u^{*}_{n} + \frac{\Delta t}{2} a^{exp}_{n+1}+  (\Delta t) a^{imp}_{n+1}.
 \end{equation}

Including the forcing terms into this equations gives
 \begin{equation}
u_{n+1} = u^{*}_{n} + \frac{\Delta t}{2M} ( F^{exp} _{n+1}) +   \frac{\Delta t}{M}     \Bigg(  c_{w} |u^{o}_{n} -u_{n} | (u^{o}_{n} -u_{n+1} )   \Bigg)
 \end{equation}
Solving for $u(t_{n+1})$ in terms of quantities which only depend on the previous time step gives
 \begin{equation}
u_{n+1} = \frac{u^{*}_{n} + \frac{\Delta t}{2M} ( F^{exp}_{n+1}) +   \frac{\Delta t}{M}    \Bigg(  c_{w} |u^{o}_{n} -u_{n} | (u^{o}_{n} )   \Bigg)}{  \Bigg( 1+  \frac{\Delta t}{M}       c_{w} |u^{o}_{n} -u_{n} |    \Bigg)}
 \end{equation}
Once the $u_{n+1}$  has been found, it can be used to calculate the explicit and implicit accelerations, which are required for the next time step.

Finally, we note that the the drag term (equation \ref{eq:Drag}) is not entirely implicit, since the element velocity inside the absolute value is evaluated at time $t_{n}$, rather than at time $t_{n+1}$. This is done so that we can solve for the updated velocity analytically. One consequence of this is that it can give rise to a small oscillation in the element velocity. This oscillation is addressed by using a predictive corrective scheme: after solving for a first guess of the velocity at time $t_{n+1}$, this estimate of the velocity is used to update the estimate of the drag force (i.e.: inside the absolute value signs). This updated drag, can now be used to repeat the process described above to find an improved estimate of the velocity. We found that two iterations were sufficient to remove the unwanted oscillation.

The procedure described in this section is easily extended to include more forcing terms and two dimensions (where it involves inverting a $2 \times 2$ matrix).




\section{Appendix C}
\textbf{Connecting bonds across processor boundaries}\\
Since the LTIM model is parallelized across multiple processors, it often happens that two elements on different processes are bonded together. Keeping track of numerical bonds across processor boundaries requires a lot of book keeping. In this section we describe the how LTIM model handles bonds across processor boundaries.

%When a bonded element moves off the edge of a processor, the bond needs to be broken (to avoid segmentation faults). Before the next time step, the code performs a `halo update', and a copy of the element is written to the halo of the original processor. After this, the bond which was broken at the previous time step, needs to be reconnected. This processes of severing and reconnecting bonds requires a lot of bookkeeping, some of which are described below.

The basics of the bond bookkeeping work as follows:
consider an element A and an element B that are bonded together. Each element has a copy of the bond (a piece of memory which describes the bond between the two elements), which is stored with the element. Let A-B be the bond stored by element A, and B-A be the bond stored by element B. Bond A-B contains a pointer which points to element B and bond B-A contains a pointer which points to element A.

Consider a situation where element A and B are originally on Processor 1, and then element B moves to Processor 2. When this occurs, the memory assigned to element B on processor 1 is removed, and is allocated on Processor 2. This means that the pointer to element B in bond A-B (stored in element A on Processor 1) is no longer assigned. Similarly, the pointer to element A in bond B-A (stored in element B on Processor 2) is no longer assigned. Before the next time step, a halo update occurs, so that the there is a copy of element A in the halo of Processor 2 and a copy of element B in the halo of Processor 1. After the halo update, the bonds A-B and B-A have to be reconnected on both Processor 1 and 2. To aid in reconnecting the bonds, a copy of the grid cell number of element B is stored in the bond A-B and a copy of the grid cell number of element A is stored in the bond B-A. We refer to this as the `most recent address'. Before a bond is moved from one processor to another, the `most recent address' is updated, so that the bond can be reconnected later. To reconnect bond A-B on Processor 1 (for example), we find the most recent address of element B, and search through the list of elements in the grid cell corresponding to the most recent address of element B until element B is found. The pointer to element B in bond A-B is reassigned and the bond is said to be connected. 

Once all bonds are reconnected, a bond quality control is done where we loop through all bonds and check that they are working properly. To check that a bond is working properly is a four step process. For example, consider the bond A-B stored in element A on Processor 1. To check the quality of this bond, we use the following four steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Check that the pointer to element B is assigned on bond A-B (stored on element A).
\item Check that the corresponding bond B-A exists on element B.
\item Check that a pointer to element A exists in this bond B-A.
\item Check that the element A which is being pointed to is the same element A where you started.
\end{enumerate}
All four of these tests must pass in order to make sure that the memory is correctly assigned. A useful tool in this process is that each element is assigned a unique number so that elements are easily identified.


\section{Appendix D}
The experiment configuration used to initialize the calving tabular iceberg simulation (in this study) is the same as that of the Ocean0 setup in the MISOMIP, with the following three changes made:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The `calving criteria' used in the MISOMIP study (which states that all points in the ice shelf with thickness less than 100m are set to zero thickness) has not been used.
\item The ice shelf has been thickened on the flanks of the domain, so that the latitude of the grounding line increases away from the center of the ice shelf.
\item The ice shelf is configured to be symmetric about its meridional center line ($x=\frac{L_{x}}{2}$). This was achieved by using the average of the left and right flanks of the ice-shelf thickness. 
\end{enumerate}
These three changes were made in order to make the circulation beneath the ice shelf easier to interpret.

%\caption{Description of the iceberg calving classes used in the model. {\it Mass}, {\it Length}, {\it Area} and {\it Th} refer to the iceberg mass, length, area, and thickness at the time of calving.  {\it Scaling} is the number of icebergs represented by one Lagrangian point particle. The iceberg mass and thickness for each class are the same as those reported in \citet{Gladstone2001}. The iceberg area and length for each class is calculated from the iceberg mass and thickness by assuming that the icebergs are cuboids with a length to width ratio of 1.5, using an iceberg density $\rho_{i}=850$kg/$\textrm{m}^{3}$.}
% Note that the areas of the iceberg classes (calculated from the iceberg lengths and masses given in \citep{Gladstone2001}) are not monotonically increasing.

\caption{Schematic showing how Lagrangian elements are used when modeling tabular icebergs. Lagrangian elements (blue dots) are initialized in a staggered lattice covering the surface area of the iceberg. For purposed of mass aggregation, the ice elements are assumed to have hexagonal shape (grey hexagons). For purposed of element interactions, the ice elements are assumed to be circular (black circles). Elements are initially bonded to adjacent elements using numerical bonds (dashed white lines). These numerical bonds form equilateral triangles which give the shape rigidity. The inset panel shows a schematic of the intersection of a hexagonal element and the ocean grid. The colors indicate the fraction of the hexagon that lies in each grid cell. These fractions are used as weights to spread LTIM properties to the ocean grid (see text for more details) The background photo in the larger schematic is an areal photograph of iceberg PIIB (Area= 42 $\textrm{km}^{2}$) taken in Baffin Bay in 2012.
